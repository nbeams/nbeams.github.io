            <p> Work with my postdoc advisor, Adrianna Gillman.</p>
            <p> The Hierarchical Poincar&eacute;-Steklov (HPS) method is a 
                 discretization technique based on domain decomposition 
                 and classical spectral collocation methods.  It is accurate
                 and robust, even for highly oscillatory solutions. An associated
                 fast direct solver is built from hierarchically merging Poincar&eacute;-Steklov
                 operators on box boundaries and storing the necessary information; the solve stage then involves
                 applying the operators  in a series of small matrix-vector multiplications.</p>
           <p> We are working on parallelizing, optimizing, and accelerating the algorithm, especially the build stage.
                This will be crucial in 3D.  Our 2D shared memory parallelization technique has already reduced the build stage times from 
                 approximately 10 minutes to approximately 30 seconds for over 3 million unknowns. </p>

           <p> 
               We developed and implemented a new, high order finite element-integral equation coupling method for 
               elliptic interface problems. The method leverages the strengths of FE and IE 
               methods to handle different aspects of the problem. It can handle general jump conditions at the interface, 
               and the jump conditions appear <i>only</i> in the right hand side of the system to be solved.
               Additionally, method does not suffer from loss of convergence order near the boundary when the boundary is smooth
               and the problem data can be extended as necessary across the interface. 
               It also doesn't require the construction or use of any special basis functions; in fact,
               much of the standard machinery for both the FE and IE solvers can be used, simplifying implementation 
               from a software standpoint.  </p>

            <p> The goal of this project was to create an FE-based version of the particle-particle&ndash;particle-mesh (P3M)
               methods for N-body problems.  P3M methods separate particle interactions into short-range (only required for near neighbors)
               and far-field (smooth, and solved easily on a mesh with your favorite numerical method). A common choice is to achieve the P-P/P-M 
splitting through Gaussian screen functions (as in the classic Ewald sum) and solve the mesh problem with FFTs.</p>

           <p> We developed a method which constructs special polynomial screen functions out of finite element basis functions.  
               Thus the screens are represented exactly on the finite element mesh, removing several possible sources of error 
              in a finite element solution to the mesh problem.  Indeed, we aimed to make the mesh problem especially suited to
               being solved with finite elements, avoiding the geometry restrictions and parallel communication burdens of the FFT. </p>
